    <h3>A delicious and easy meal!</h3>
    <p>Mix miso, sake and soy sauce into a marinade. Spread over the fillets and let it sit for at least 30 minutes (marinating overnight will yield the best results).</p>
    <p>Broil the salmon for 6 to 10 minutes. It's as easy as that!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons red miso or 3 tablespoons white miso</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon sake</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar (less or more to taste)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 (6-ounce) skinless salmon fillets</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Mix the miso, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a small bowl. Adjust proportions to taste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour half of the mixture into a container large enough to fit the salmon fillets, then pour the rest over the top of the fish.</p>
            <p>Make sure the fish is coated with the miso sauce. Cover the container and marinate for at least 30 minutes, and up to overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil. Brush a little vegetable oil over the foil and lay the salmon fillets on top. </p>
            <p>Make sure there is an even, thin coating of marinade on top of the fish. </p>
            <p>Place the fillets no closer than about 6 inches from the broiler element in your oven. </p> 
            <p>Broil for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how thick the fillets are and how hot your broiler is.</p>
